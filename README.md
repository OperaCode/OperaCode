# Raphael Faboyinde — Opera  
### Full-Stack Engineer • Technical and Team Builder • BlockChain & Web3 Builder.  

I design infrastructures,processes and build with intent across Web2 and Web3.

My work sits at the intersection of **real-world product systems.**  
I focus on how systems behave — ** data flow, reliability, and scale.**

I don’t just build apps. I build **systems that persist, coordinate, and evolve.**

## Current Direction

- Building **PayWise** — Financial infrastructure & automated payment architecture  
- Studying **Ethereum internals, state trees, and protocol mechanics**  
- Deepening **backend performance, distributed systems & DevOps**  
- Exploring **AI + intelligent system integration**

## Engineering Focus

- Stateful backend systems  
- Financial & payment architecture  
- Blockchain & cryptographic state  
- API and data flow design  
- Performance & reliability  
- System thinking over surface implementation
